## Getting Started

The labrep directory contains the general template. For a more clear example checkout L1 this contains an example lab report using this template.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- Groff
- ps2pdf
- make

## Usage

`labrep/labreport.ms` contains the general template file. `labrep/tmac.lab` contains the extra macros I have added to extend the `ms` macros. `labrep/Makefile` is a simple makefile that can be used with this template.

To compile the example

```
cd L1
make
```
